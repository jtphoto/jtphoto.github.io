                  <p>“I'm totally blown away by how amazing my experience with Joyce was. She was such a pleasure to shoot my senior photos with and she even brought along an assistant to filter any harsh sunlight directly out of the photos.
The obvious time and effort she spent in not only taking the photos, but then editing them after really showed in the photos when I received them. I'm really glad my roommate recommended Joyce because there's no way I could have gotten better photos from any other photographer. Thank you Joyce!!” <strong>–Lauren H</strong>

                  <p>“Working with Joyce was an absolute treat! She took my grad photos two weeks ago, and it was a great experience. She very graciously extended the length of our session so I could take pictures at specific spots on campus, and she was incredibly patient and kind with me for the whole 2+ hours. She then returned the photos to me extremely promptly, and they were all fantastic! I'm very sad that I likely won't be around Austin to work with Joyce again, and I encourage everyone to make her the photographer of any and all special events in your life!”<strong>–Marisa S</strong>

I'm so happy I got to work with her for my graduation photos. She is friendly, patient, and dedicated - I highly recommend her!” <strong>-Tiffany C</strong>

                      “Joyce is friendly and professional! She was a real trooper – we had to reschedule my shoot due to rain, and then the weather wasn’t entirely on our side on our rescheduled date either. It rained briefly, but during that time Joyce took me inside and was quick on her feet to think of other places we could take pictures. She really respected my time and did her best to get the most out of our session despite the weather. My family and I loved all of the photos! Joyce is so talented and affordable, I really recommend her.” <strong>Jessica S</strong>

                      “I had an excellent time working with Joyce (and Tiffany) for my two events. The coverage they provided me was a new experience for them, but they took it in stride and delivered beautiful work. The turnaround of the digital album was amazingly quick! That was wonderful because we have already shared the wedding event photos with our families. Joyce is professional and I am very satisfied with her communication. E-mails were answered within a day as were phone calls and texts. Thank you again for your hard work! I hope you enjoyed the experience as well!” <strong>Affifa R</strong>
